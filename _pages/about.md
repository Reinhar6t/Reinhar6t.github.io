I recently graduated from the Technical University of Munich with a master's degree in Mechatronics and Robotics. During my master's studies, I completed a thesis titled "A Novel Strategy for Human-Robot Collaboration by Leveraging Human Behavior" under the supervision of Prof. Dr.-Ing. Darius Burschka. During my studies, I worked as an intern in the BMW Group developing driver assistance systems. Prior to this, I worked as a mechanical engineer in Hefei BOE Display Technology Co., Ltd.. Before that, I obtained my bachelor's degree in Mechanical Design and Manufacturing and Automation from Hefei University of Technology.
